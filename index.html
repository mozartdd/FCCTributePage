                        Mozart was born on January 27, 1756, in Salzburg, Austria, to Leopold and Anna Maria Mozart.
                        By the age of 3, he displayed remarkable musical talent, and by 5, he was already composing simple
                        pieces and performing in public.

                        At the age of 6, Mozart and his sister, Maria Anna ("Nannerl"), toured Europe, performing for royalty
                         and aristocracy. These early tours showcased Mozart's prodigious talent and brought him
                         international recognition.

                    <li class="three list"><span class="li-text">
                        At just 8 years old, Mozart composed his first symphony in E-flat major (K. 16) while in London, a 
                         remarkable feat that demonstrated his genius as a composer.

                        Mozart was appointed a court musician in Salzburg by Prince-Archbishop Colloredo. During this 
                        period, he composed several important works, including "Symphony No. 25" and many violin concertos.

                    <li class="five list"><span class="li-text">
                        Mozart wrote his first successful opera, "La Finta Giardiniera", at the age of 19.

                        After a falling out with the Archbishop of Salzburg, Mozart moved to Vienna, where he became a freelance musician.
                         This was a daring move that allowed him to compose some of his most famous works but also led to financial struggles.

                        Mozart married Constanze Weber on August 4, 1782, against his father's wishes. Their marriage was full of love,

                        In the final year of his life, Mozart composed "The Magic Flute", an opera filled with innovative 
                        music and symbolism. It became one of his most popular works.
